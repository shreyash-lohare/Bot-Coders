1. **Acknowledgments**:
   - We have utilized **Claude** for initial guidance in developing the client-server networking code used within this project.
   - This project is currently in a development phase, and features are subject to change as the game is refined and optimized.

2. **Third-Party Tools and Generative AI**:
   - This project includes graphical assets and background edits created with the help of the following tools:
     - [**Remove.bg**](https://www.remove.bg/): Used for background removal to allow characters to seamlessly integrate with game backgrounds.
     - [**Pixlr**](https://pixlr.com/): Utilized for AI-based image editing and prompt generation.
     - [**Luma Labs**](https://lumalabs.ai/): Experimented with this tool for in-game animation, although ultimately it was not incorporated into the final design.
     - [**Adobe**](https://adobe.com): Used to create the primary bot characters, with blue and green color themes, using basic shapes and a rectangular design.
     - [**PhotoRoom**](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/remove-object-from-photo): Used to remove unwanted elements from specific images without altering the background.
   - Generative AI was used to help frame the structure and design of certain elements, which were then customized and enhanced with original elements.
