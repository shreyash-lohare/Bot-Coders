## 2. Acknowledgments & Credits

### Special Acknowledgment

- **Claude**: This project has benefited from the assistance of **Claude**, an AI tool, which provided initial guidance in the development of the client-server networking code used within the game. This contribution significantly helped streamline the networking architecture.

### Third-Party Tools & Generative AI

This project employs a variety of third-party tools and generative AI applications to enhance its graphical and functional aspects. Below are the tools utilized, along with their specific contributions:

- **[Remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/)**: This tool was instrumental in background removal, allowing characters to be integrated seamlessly into various game environments. By eliminating backgrounds, it ensures that assets blend smoothly within the gameâ€™s visual context.

- **[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)**: Utilized for AI-driven image editing and prompt generation, Pixlr helped refine graphical assets and improve their visual appeal through easy-to-use editing tools.

- **[Luma Labs](https://lumalabs.ai/)**: This tool was explored for in-game animation, though it ultimately did not make it into the final design. Experimentation with Luma Labs provided insights into animation techniques, which informed later decisions about animations created within the game.

- **[Adobe](https://adobe.com)**: Adobe software was used to design the primary bot characters featured in the game. The software facilitated the creation of visually distinct characters utilizing blue and green color themes, employing basic shapes to maintain a consistent aesthetic.

- **[PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/tools/remove-object-from-photo)**: This tool enabled the removal of unwanted elements from specific images while preserving the integrity of the background. This was particularly useful for refining visual assets used within the game.

- **Generative AI**: AI was leveraged to help frame the structural design of various game elements, from character concepts to level designs. Initial drafts produced by generative AI were customized and enhanced with original elements, resulting in a more unique and cohesive game experience.
